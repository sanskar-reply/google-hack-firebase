# Vertex Document Processor

This is a [next.js](https://nextjs.org) app that takes a user-provided question and an input document (e.g. PDF, image, etc) and sends it to Gemini.

It is intended to help you see the benefits of [Gemini Code Assist](https://cloud.google.com/products/gemini/code-assist?hl=en) as you modify it and deploy it to Cloud.
